# Shared helpers for the merge-request note scripts. Sourced, not executed.
#
# Environment:
#   GITLAB_API_TOKEN       required by every caller. See require_token.
#   CI_API_V4_URL          required. Set by GitLab CI.
#   CI_PROJECT_ID          required. Set by GitLab CI. Never defaulted to a
#                          literal: that works in one repository and is
#                          silently wrong in every other.
#   CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID   required. Only set on merge-request pipelines.
#   MR_NOTE_INTERPRETER    optional. Force `python3` or `node` for JSON
#                          parsing. Auto-detected otherwise; exists so the
#                          tests can exercise both branches.
#
# Why two interpreters: these scripts run in two different images. The visual
# and preview jobs need node, because Playwright and the application build do.
# The workspace's own pipeline runs on a python image. A script that assumed
# either works in one and fails in the other, and it fails by finding no note
# at all, so every run posts a duplicate instead of erroring.

# Fail before anything reaches the network. Without this the request goes out
# unauthenticated and comes back as an opaque 401, which reads as an outage
# rather than as a missing variable.
